                <p>
                 The right to participation emphasizes the evolving capacities of children and recognizes that their
                 participation contributes to their personal development and the well-being of society as a whole. 
                 Governments, families, communities, and other stakeholders are encouraged to create opportunities for meaningful
                 and age-appropriate participation of children in decision-making processes that affect them.
